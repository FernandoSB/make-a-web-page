  	<h1>Lesson 1: Important Concepts</h1>

  		<div>
		<h2><em>How the Web Works</em></h2>

			<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h2><em>HTML</em></h2>

			<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".</p>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h2><em>Tags and Elements</em></h2>

			<p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.<br><br> <b>In my first lesson, I learnt a few tags like: bold, image, anchor, break and paragraph. There are 2 types of tags: i) Open-Close Tags and ii) Void Tags. Some of the Tags have attributes that are used to give orders that are more complex, for instance, open an image from certain URL, make a link or give an alternative answer.</b></p>
		</div>

		<div>
		<h2><em>Why Computers are Stupid</em><br></h2>

			<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
  		<h2><em>Inline vs Block Elements</em></h2>

			<p>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.<br><br> <b>It is important to bear in mind the Block Elements, I think it would be helpful to manipulate a set HTML instructions as a whole set. Let's see if that is true!</b></p>
		</div>

<div class="lesson">
		<h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Web Page: Boxifying</h1>

	<div>
		<h2><em>Use of Squares: The Block Elements</em><br></h2>
			<p>A web page design can be divided in multiple squares, that is how a programmer  can focus in programing a whole web page by pieces which are "Squares". The browser is able to read and display each programmed square. To define a square (or a box) to give a specific purpose we use container elements such as the tag <b>"div"</b>.<br><br>In order to program in a nice and clean way, we should classify (or named) each boxand then follow a "Tree Like Structure". In other words: "DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree."<br><br>As we saw in Lesson 1, the HTML is used to give a structure to a web page. Once it is duly organized, every <em>Block Element</em> can be manipulated, I guess, with CSS and Java Lenguajes.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2><em>CSS Language</em><br></h2>
  			<p>The CSS language is use to give a <em>STYLE</em> to every element in a web page, previously estrucutured with HTML.</p>
  	</div>

	<div>
		<h2><em>Tools</em><br></h2>
  			<p>There are many tools make coding much easier. To start programming my own web page a I a use Scratchpad, Codepen or Sublime. <br>Also, I can use <em>Chrome</em> to see the structure of a specific web page or to have a much faster preview of your changes.<br>
  			There are many others web pages useful to find any code like CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">references</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/">tricks</a>, and others to verify it, for both  <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check">HTLM</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator">CSS</a>. </p>

	<h1>Lesson 3: Structure and Style</h1> 


	<div>
		<h2><em>Avoid Repetition</em><br>	</h2>
			<p>We learnt that: "HTML is the structure of a website, while CSS is the interior decorations and Java Script is the mechanical parts like a garage door."..., "Everything in HTML can be divided into boxes that can be nested inside of other boxes which allows us to create the structure needed. When a front end web developer gets a design for a webpage from a designer the first step is to identify and outline all the boxes on the page, this is what is meant by "Boxifying""..., <br>"Inheritance is a key property of CSS to reduce workload and reduce errors when editing code. Inheritance relys on the document structure where parent elements pass on certain traits to child elements such as font, color, or letter spacing. In general only text-related properties can be inherited as opposed to box-related properties (e.g. padding, or margin) This concept helps to avoid errors from repeating steps and also creates consistency in the style of the webpage."..., <br>"Identifiers allow for us to specify which HTML elements we want to modify and again help us to make consistency in the style of the page and to reduce errors when writing and editing code. One example of this is if we want to reference an element from our HTML we specify the element and inside brackets we can change properties of the element like this: h1{...inside here we adjust properties of this element...} Inside the brackets the change to a property of the element is specified like: name: value; (e.g. color: red;)".</p>

		<h2><em>Front End Design Skills</em><br></h2>
			<p>Yes I know, it is not my best skill. Keep studying the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">references</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/">tricks</a></p>
